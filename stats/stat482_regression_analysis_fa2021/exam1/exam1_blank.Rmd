# Problem 1
> Experience with a certain type of plastic indicates that a relationship exists
> between the hardness (measured in Brinell units) of items molded from the
> plastic (response variable $y$ ) and the elapsed time (measured in hours)
> since the termination of the molding process (input variable $x$).
> Sixteen batches of the plastic were made, and from each batch one test item
> was molded. Each test item was randomly assigned to one of the four
> predetermined time levels. The data is available on Blackboard as a csv file.

## (a)
> State the simple linear regression model.

\vspace{50pt}

## (b)
> Provide an interpretation for the regression parameter

\vspace{50pt}

## (c)
> Compute an interval estimate for $\beta_1$, stated in the context of the
> problem.

\vspace{50pt}

## (d)
> Compute a confidence interval for $h$ at $x_h = 40$ hours.

\vspace{50pt}

## (e)
> Compute a prediction interval for $Y_{h(\text{new})}$ at $x_h = 40$ hours.

\vspace{50pt}

## (f)
> Explain the diÂ¤erence between a confidence interval and a prediction interval,
> stated in the context of the problem.

\vspace{50pt}

## (g)
> State the equations for $E(\ms{R})$ and $\ms{E}$.

\vspace{50pt}

## (h)
> Use part (g) to explain a motivation behind the F test for input effects.

\vspace{50pt}

## (i)
> Compute the $F^*$ statistic and the $p$-value.
> Provide an interpretation of the result, stated in the context of the problem.

\vspace{50pt}

## (j)
> Compute the coefficient of determination $r^2$.
> Provide an interpretation of the result, stated in the context of the problem.

\vspace{50pt}

## (k)
> State the full model (saturated model) in testing for regression model fit.

\vspace{50pt}

## (l)
> Compute $\sos{PE}$ and $\sos{LF}$ for testing the fit of the linear regression
> model.

\vspace{50pt}

## (m)
> Compute the $F_{LF}$ statistic and the $p$-value.
> Provide an interpretation of the result, stated in the context of the problem.

\vspace{50pt}

## (n)
> Create a plot comparing the fitted values from the regression model with the
> fitted values from the saturated model.

\vspace{50pt}

## (o)
> Explain an advantage of using the regression estimate $\hat{\mu}_{40}$ instead
> of the sample mean $\bar{y}_{40}$ and explain when this advantage will lead to
> a more accurate estimator.

# Problem 2
> Measurements were made on men involved in a physical fitness course. The input
> variables under consideration are age (in years), weight (in kgs), time to run
> 1.5 miles (in minutes), heart rate while resting (in bpm), heart rate while
> running, and maximum heart rate. The goal is to determine which input
> variables are needed to model the oxygen uptake rate (ml/kg body weight per
> minute). The data is available on Blackboard as a csv file.

\vspace{50pt}

## (a)
> Describe the goal of the discrepancy function approach to model selection. How
> is the best model defined? What are the two sources of model error?

\vspace{50pt}

## (b)
> Plot the $C_p$ statistic against the model dimension. Plot the $C_p$ statistic
> against the candidate models. Which variables are included in the selected
> model?

\vspace{50pt}

## (c)
> Test the selected model against its best competitor having fewer parameters.
> (Compute the test statistic and the $p$-value.) How does discrepancy based
> model selection compare to $p$-value based selection?
