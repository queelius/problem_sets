## Equations

::: {#foo .theorem name="Addition"}
Consider
$$
    1+1=2               (\#eq:ok2)
$$
and suppose it is false!
:::

::: {.proof}
This is a proof of theorem \@ref(thm:foo)
:::

I refer to it using Equation \@ref(eq:ok2).

Here is an equation.

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
  f\left(k\right) = \binom{n}{k} p^k\left(1-p\right)^{n-k}
  (\#eq:binom)
\end{equation}
```

You may refer to using `\@ref(eq:binom)`, like see Equation \@ref(eq:binom).

## Theorems and proofs

Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using `\@ref(thm:tri)`, for example, check out this smart theorem \@ref(thm:tri).

::: {#tri .theorem}
For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the *length* of the hypotenuse and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the **other** two sides, we have $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
