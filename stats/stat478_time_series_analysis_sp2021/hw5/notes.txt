This feature of the ACF is very helpful in identifying the MA model and
its appropriate order as it "cuts off" after lag q.

In real life applications, however, the sample ACF, r(k), will not
necessarily be equal to zero after lag q. It is expected to become very
small in absolute value after lag q. For a data set of N observations,
this is often tested against +- 2/sqrt(N) limits.
where 1/sqrt(N) is the approximate value for the standard deviation of the
ACF for any lag under the assumption corr(k) = 0 for all kâ€™s as discussed
in Chapter 2.
